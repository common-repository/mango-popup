Mango Popup helps you grow your email list with just few clicks. Only thing you need to do is focus on making content, we do the rest.

== Description ==
= WHY DID WE MAKE THIS PLUGIN? =
We found a lot of plugins in wordpress.org that help people create popups, but we also found that almost all of them are complex, with ton of features but hard to use. So our team decided to make a plugin that helps everyone to create their own popups with only content marketing ideas on their mind, no technical skill needed, no more confused about bunch of options and that's it. We hope it fits you well, thanks for giving us a try!
